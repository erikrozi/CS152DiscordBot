# CS 152 Discord Bot Group 21

## Datasets

Datasets are stored in `data/`. We use two datasets, OLID and offensive/non-offensive imagery.

## Code

`bot.py` stores the majority of our code that directly interacts with the bot, including code that interacts with our MongoDB instance. `modFlow.py` and `report.py` handle our modflow and reporting flow respectively, and `ocr.py` handles basic OCR functionality within Discord. Feel free to test OCR capabilities with the Discord bot also.
